[Marketing campaign data](https://github.com/VictoriaMaslova/HypothesisTesting/blob/main/marketing_data.csv)


## How to run the code

Option1. Running using free online resource

You can find highly-detailed explanation, try the code directly on [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/victoriamiller19/hypothesis-testing-explanation). Save a copy in your drive and enjoy It!

Option 2: Running on your computer locally

Install VS Code.

Setup a Python environment. On mac OS, it already has Python 2 but I recommend not using that. Instead, I recommend installing Python 3 via Homebrew.

Install the Jupyter package.

Select the Python environment (with the Jupyter package)

Open and edit .ipynb files.
